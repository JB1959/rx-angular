/**
 * @description
 * Limits the number of synchronous emitted a value from the source Observable to
 * one emitted value per
 *   [`AnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestAnimationFrame), then repeats
 *   this process for every tick of the browsers event loop.
 *
 * The coalesce operator is based on the [throttle](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api/operators/throttle) operator.
 * In addition to that is provides emitted values for the trailing end only, as well as maintaining a context to scope
 *   coalescing.
 *
 * @param {function(value: T): SubscribableOrPromise} durationSelector - A function
 * that receives a value from the source Observable, for computing the silencing
 * duration for each source value, returned as an Observable or a Promise.
 * It defaults to `requestAnimationFrame` as durationSelector.
 * @param {Object} config - A configuration object to define `leading` and `trailing` behavior and the context object.
 * Defaults to `{ leading: false, trailing: true }`. The default scoping is per subscriber.
 * @return {Observable<T>} An Observable that performs the coalesce operation to
 * limit the rate of emissions from the source.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * Emit clicks at a rate of at most one click per second
 * ```ts
 * import { fromEvent, animationFrames } from 'rxjs';
 * import { coalesce } from 'ngRx/component';
 *
 * const clicks = fromEvent(document, 'click');
 * const result = clicks.pipe(coalesce(ev => animationFrames));
 * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 * ```
