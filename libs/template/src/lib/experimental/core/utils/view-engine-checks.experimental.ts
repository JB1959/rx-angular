 * envRunsIvy
 *
 * @description
 * Determines the used view engine of an Angular project is Ivy or not.
 * The check is done based on following table:
 * | render       | ViewEngine | ViewEngine | Ivy         | Ivy         |
 * | ------------ | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- |
 * | **mode**     | prod       | dev        | prod        | dev         |
 * | **ng**       | present    | present    | `undefined` | present     |
 * | **ng.probe** | present    | present    | `undefined` | `undefined` |
 *
 *  So for Ivy we need to make sure that ng is undefined or,
 *  in case of dev environment, ng.probe is undefined.
 *
 * @return {boolean} - true if the used view engine is Ivy.
